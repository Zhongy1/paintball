## Run

Install the libraries first if you have not:
```
$ npm install
```

Bundle the front end
```
$ npm run frontend.build
```

Run the server
```
$ npm run server
```

You should now be able to access localhost:3000 from a browser

## Develop

Install project dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

Start the dev server for the front end
```
$ npm run frontend.dev
```

Run the server
```
$ npm run server
```
Now you can access the application at localhost:3000 and any changes made to the front end code will be recompiled on save.
